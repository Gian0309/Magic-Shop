					<li><p>Be open-minded about mental illnesses. They are not weaknesses nor are they something made up to gain attention.</p></li>
					<li><p>Set time aside with no distractions. Ease into the conversation gradually. It may take some time but that’s okay.</p></li>
					<li><p>Let them share as much or as little as they want. Do not pressure them to share more than they want or are able to. </p></li>
					<li><p>Do not try to diagnose or second guess their feelings. Unless you are a professional, you should not make assumptions or diagnose immediately.</p></li>
					<li><p>Be a good listener. Do not cut them off when they are talking and try to maintain eye contact. Respond in a soft and caring manner.</p></li>
					<li><p>Keep questions open ended. Give them time, do not grill them with too many questions. Do not pry and ask questions appropriately.</p></li>
					<li><p>Talk about wellbeing. Suggest ways to de-stress and talk about ways to practice self-care. Exercising, a healthy diet, and a good night’s rest can help sustain wellbeing.</p></li>
					<li><p>Listen to what they are telling you. Respect their feelings and repeat back what they have said to assure them that you have understood what they told you.</p></li>
					<li><p>Offer them help in seeking professional support and provide information to do this. Do not make their decisions for them and allow them to decide this on their own. You must simply provide support.</p></li>
					<li><p>Know your limits. Ask help if the problem is serious. You have no business sharing this information with other people without their permission unless you are sure that they are in immediate danger.</p></li>
					<li><p>Avoid saying “Just pray about it”, “You just need to change your attitude”, and “Everyone feels that way sometimes”. Do not assume things about them, make sarcastic comments, raise your voice, and talk too much.</p></li>
					<li><p>When dealing with this, you should, at the very least, try to research about their problem to ensure that you would not say things out of line and so that you could find ways to be able to help them.</p></li>
					<li><p>Do not get ahead of their feelings. If they are not ready, do not pressure them because it might only make things worse. </p></li>
					<li><p>Give them a big hug to show that you care about them and that you'll never leave their side. Sometimes, you do not really need to say anything to that person because that hug can convey a lot of words you may not be able to say.</p></li>

				<ul>
					<li><p>Try to talk to someone about it. It might be hard but seeking professional help may be the best thing you can do. If not, talk to someone close to you because even though they might not understand what you’re going through, they might be able to help you.</p></li>
					<li><p>Do not be too harsh on yourself for feeling these emotions because no one is ever too privileged to feel this way. Just because you have everything you will ever need does not magically make everything okay about you. You also have emotional needs that are supposed to be met.</p></li>
					<li><p>Do not pressure yourself to do things that you can do and take it one step at a time. Things could get overwhelming so when it comes to this point, try to take a deep breath and take on it slowly. Set achievable goals and do not pressure yourself to do more than you are able to.</p></li>
					<li><p>It might be hard but try to practice self-care. Drink water, take a bath, eat a health meal, and get a full night’s sleep. Achieving these things is already a big step to trying to help yourself even though they seem small and insignificant.</p></li>
					<li><p>Try not to listen to what other people are saying about you. In this world, there will always be someone who will not like you or will judge you because that is just how the world works. Always remember that these things do not make you any less of a person.</p></li>
					<li><p>Do what makes you happy. Set time aside for you to do something for yourself like watching your favorite show, painting, cooking, baking and drawing. </p></li>
					<li><p>Rest when you need to. Do not force yourself to continue working when you now that you are tired. Pressuring yourself to continue doing work may lead to experiencing burnout.</p>

					<li><p>Offer them medicine if they take it during an attack. </p></li>
					<li><p>Try to breathe with them so that they could slow down and control their breathing. Reassure them by saying “I’m proud of you” or “You can do this”. </p></li>
